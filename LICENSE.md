# Repository Licensing

SheetXL contains a mix of open-source and commercially licensed packages. Each package is individually licensed and contains its own license file.

For the specific terms and conditions applicable to a package, please see the `LICENSE.md` file located in that package's root directory.

Generally, packages intended for public distribution (such as CLIs, adapters, and vanilla wrappers) are licensed under the MIT license. All other core packages are proprietary and require a commercial license for use.
