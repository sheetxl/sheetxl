# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** September 1, 2025
**Who we are:** SheetXL, Inc. (“SheetXL”, “we”, “us”)

SheetXL takes your privacy seriously. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## Information we collect

**Website/server logs.** When you visit our site, our servers automatically record basic logs (e.g., IP address, browser type, referrer, timestamp). We use these for security, debugging, and to keep the service running. These logs are not used to identify you.

**Account sign-in.** If you sign in to register or manage licenses, we collect:

- Your **email address** (required)
- Your **display/public name** from the identity provider, if available

We do **not** collect other profile data from your identity provider.

## How we use your information

- To **create and manage your account** and registered licenses
- To **communicate** about your account, licenses, renewals, and important service updates
- To **protect the service**, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues
- To **comply with legal obligations**

We do not sell your personal information.

## Cookies and tracking

We do **not** use cookies or similar tracking technologies on our public site at this time. If that changes, we’ll update this policy and provide appropriate notice/controls.

## Third parties / processors

We use a small number of service providers to operate SheetXL. These providers act as our processors and only process your data on our instructions:

- **Supabase** (including authentication/hosting) – used for account sign-in and storing minimal account data
- **Identity provider** you choose to sign in with (e.g., Google) – used only to authenticate you and provide your email/display name
- **Email provider** – used to send account/operational emails

We do not run ads and we do not use third-party advertising or analytics trackers.

## Data retention

- **Account and licensing data:** kept while your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward (typically up to **24 months**) for audit, fraud prevention, and legal/compliance purposes, unless a longer retention is required by law.
- **Server logs:** typically retained for up to **90 days** unless needed to investigate security incidents.

## Security

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to keep your data safe.

## Your choices and rights

- **Access / update:** You can request a copy of your account data or ask us to correct it.
- **Deletion:** You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data (subject to data we must keep for legal or security reasons).
- **Communications:** Operational emails about your account/licenses are required; we don’t send marketing emails.

To exercise any of the above, email **legal@sheetxl.com** from the address associated with your account.

> If you are in a region with specific privacy rights (e.g., EU/UK/California), we will honor applicable requests consistent with local law.

## Children’s privacy

SheetXL is not directed to children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## International transfers

If you access the Service from outside the country where our systems are hosted, your information may be processed in other countries. We take steps to protect your information consistent with this policy.

## Changes to this policy

If we make material changes, we’ll update the effective date and, where appropriate, notify you (e.g., via email or a notice on the site). The current version will always be available on our website.
