## The Gist

SheetXL, Inc. (“SheetXL,” “we,” or “us”) provides both open-source and commercially licensed software components. In addition, we maintain an account management service that enables you to register, manage, and renew licenses. Creating an account is required only if you purchase or register a license.

For paid licenses, you will be charged on a yearly basis in accordance with the applicable pricing schedule. You can cancel anytime, but fees are non-refundable.

We may update these Terms of Service, our account management service, or our pricing at any time. The most current version will always be posted on our website.

By using our website, account management service, or related services (collectively, the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service.

1. Acceptance of Terms

These Terms govern your use of the Service. Use of the SheetXL software itself is governed by the separate
[End-User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.sheetxl.com/docs/eula). In case of conflict, the EULA prevails with respect to software use.

2. Accounts and Billing

To purchase or register a license, you must create an account and provide accurate, complete information.

License fees are billed on a yearly basis per the applicable license model (e.g., per developer, per application).

Fees are non-refundable except as required by law.

You are responsible for all activity under your account.

3. Use of Service

You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you may not:

Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Service.

Use the Service to violate applicable law.

Attempt to access the Service or accounts of other users without authorization.

The Service, including the account portal, branding, and related content, is the property of SheetXL and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. Nothing in these Terms grants you rights in our trademarks or service marks.

The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” SheetXL makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Service, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

6. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, SheetXL shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including lost profits, business interruption, or data loss, even if advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed the fees you paid (if any) in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

7. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SheetXL, its affiliates, officers, and employees from any claim or liability arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of applicable laws.

8. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you materially breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately, but your obligations under Sections 4–7 survive.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles.
