The easiest way to use the SheetXL CLI is by running it directly without a permanent installation. All you need is Node.js (v22+) installed (v24 recommended),

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx sheetxl
```

*(If you use `pnpm`, you can use `dlx sheetxl`)*

This will start an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), pre-loaded with the SheetXL SDK.

```terminal
SheetXL >
```

:::tip
Type `help` in CLI for a list of commands.

## Usage

The CLI can be used in three main ways: as an [**interactive REPL**](#interactive-repl), for [**executing scripts**](#executing-scripts) files, or for running [**direct commands**](#direct-commands).

### Interactive REPL

Running the CLI with no arguments starts the interactive session. This is a powerful JavaScript environment for prototyping, running calculations, or managing your workbooks programmatically.

```bash
npx sheetxl
```

Inside the REPL, you have access to the `@sheetxl/sdk` and `@sheetxl/io` packages and special commands:

* `help`: Displays help message.
* `.help`: Shows all available dot commands.


#### Accessing the SDK API

You can access the sdk directly

Create a new Workbook and save with a single value.

```javascript title="New Workbook"
wb = new Workbook();
wb.getRange('a1').setValues([[1]]);
save('myWorkbook.xlsx', wb);
```

:::info API Reference
See our full [SDK API Documentation](https://api.sheetxl.com) for a complete list of all available classes and methods.

### Executing Scripts

For automation and more complex tasks, you can pass a local JavaScript file to the CLI for execution. The script will run within the SheetXL environment, with the SDK available.

```bash
npx sheetxl run path/to/your/script.js
```

### Direct Commands

You can also run specific built-in commands directly. This is useful for one-off tasks.

#### Activate Your License

To activate your license key, run the `activate` command:

```bash
npx sheetxl activate YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE
```

This will store your license key for future use.
