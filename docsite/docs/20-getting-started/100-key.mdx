Setting the License Key.

:::tip
No license key is needed during evaluation. License keys are only needed for development of an application intended for production.
:::

License keys can be generated by visiting [my-sheetxl](https://my.sheetxl.com).

License keys can be activated in multiple ways:

1. By adding the following line of code `before` using the api or rendering a component.


```jsx
  LicenseManager.setLicenseKey(`visit https://my.sheetxl.com to generate a license key.`);
```

2. Create a file 'sheetxl.lic' with the license key key as a single line that is located in the root path of your deployed application.

:::info
We understand that the license key may be visible to others; this is expected and ok as key do not contain any
personally identifiable information.
