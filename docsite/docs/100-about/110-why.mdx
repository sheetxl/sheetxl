# Why SheetXL Exists

#### and why we think you'll love It

Every complex system I have shipped hit the same wall:

**“Can you just make it like Excel?”**

It always started simple. First a grid with some formatting, maybe sorting or filtering.

Then came the requests:

* “Can we have date validation?”
* “Can we copy-paste from Excel?”
* “Can we do formulas?”
* “Why is it so slow with 20,000 rows?”

Edge cases pile up. Deadlines slip.

A data grid was the perfect fit. At first...

After years of workarounds, rewrites, and compromises, I finally took a step back and realized:

My users didn't just want to view the data; they wanted to **interact with it**.
They wanted the flexibility of a spreadsheet.

And spreadsheets were not designed for developers.

That realization led to SheetXL.

#### Excel's 40,000 micro features weren't feature requests. They were non-negotiables.

Users trust Excel. They've built workflows, intuition, and muscle memory around it.

So we matched them. Not some. Everything that matters:
400+ functions, including tricky ones like INDIRECT, XLOOKUP, and full spill behavior.
Formatting edge cases. Paste quirks. Even the subtle gestures.

#### It had to be built for developers

It had to leverage existing tech stacks, not fight them.

So we built SheetXL using the tools that developers already know and love: TypeScript, React, and modern web standards.

The goal: fewer obstacles, more productivity, more upgradability.

#### It had to be incredibly fast

Performance isn't a feature. It's the foundation of a good user experience.

So we reimagined how spreadsheets manage data.

Not just virtual rendering. True performance required rethinking storage, mutation, and calculations.

We applied design patterns from big data systems:

columnar storage, vectorized APIs, immutability, zero-copy architecture, and dependency graphs.

The result? You can throw a 250MB workbook at it or autofill a million rows with formulas, and never
skip a beat.

If any of this resonates with you, join the community and give SheetXL a try.

We'd love to hear from you and see what you've built.
