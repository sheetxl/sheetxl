**All the tools you need** to bring spreadsheet power into your application.

* **A Spreadsheet SDK**: A headless spreadsheet engine with full Excel-like logic.
* **A Data Science Framework**: Efficient APIs for modeling and analyzing large datasets.
* **UI Component Library**: Composable components to build any interface you need.
* **Embeddable App**: A full-featured, open-source spreadsheet ready to use or extend.

## Core Capabilities

### A Spreadsheet SDK
Go beyond basic tables with a powerful calculation engine supporting 400+ Excel functions,
data validation, and complex cell formatting.

### Scale to Billions of Cells
Our vectored columnar data store and virtualized rendering engine is built to handle billions of
cells and massive workbooks without breaking a sweat.

### Use only what you need
Start with our headless SDK in a Node.js environment, embed our React
components to build a custom UI, or drop in a complete, pre-built application.

### Live Scripting
Add custom functions, data validation and complex logic on the fly using TypeScript - no build
step required. It's a uniquely powerful way to prototype and extend functionality instantly.

## Our Ecosystem

SheetXL is designed as a set of composable packages to give you maximum flexibility.

A rich set of React components for building your own custom spreadsheet interfaces. You get full control over the look and feel.
