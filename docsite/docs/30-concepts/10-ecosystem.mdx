title: Our Ecosystem
---

SheetXL is structured as a modular ecosystem of packages, each with a clear and specific purpose.

This architecture was chosen intentionally to give you maximum flexibility and control. It allows
you to build your application with only the necessary components, ensuring a minimal footprint
and a clean dependency tree. For example, you can use the `@sheetxl/grid` package on its own without
the overhead of the full spreadsheet engine.

The packages below are designed for seamless interoperability and are grouped into Core, UI, and Utilities to help you find the right tool for the job.
