SheetXL's UI is built from a set of composable React Components. These can be used as standalone components or assembled together to support
a complete spreadsheet experience.

An overview of the [Studio](https://api.sheetxl.com/modules/_sheetxl_studio-mui.html) component is
shown below:

## Configuring Components

Like all React components SheetXL components are configured using properties; see [API Reference](https://api.sheetxl.com/) for the specific
properties available for each component. Most components also support the ref property; when they do they always expose the
underlying component and additional imperative API calls as defined in the Typescript interface
following the convention `<Component>`Attributes.

### App Themes

SheetXL has two types of themes.
1. App Themes are used to render the application and are configured via CSS or MUIThemeProvider.
2. Doc Themes are used for render the spreadsheet and are configured via the models and styles and saved within the document.

App Themes are configured using Material UI's [MUIThemeProvider](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/#theme-provider) component.

```typescript title="SheetXL with MUIThemeProvider"
/**
 * Wrapping a SheetXL component inside of a MUIThemeProvider.
 */
<ThemeProvider theme={currentTheme}>
  <Studio />
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### App theme extensions
SheetXL has a thin layer of customized MUI components known as 'Exhibit Components'. These extend MUI components to provide
functionality and styling needed for SheetXL. The Exhibit Components are MIT open-sourced and can be found at
[github](https://github.com/sheetxl/sheetxl/tree/main/packages/utils-mui/).

### Document Themes
Document Themes are used for rendering they managed are associated with the data so they are managed via
[document themes](https://api.sheetxl.com/interfaces/_sheetxl_sdk.ITheme.html).
