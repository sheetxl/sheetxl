## A Unified Range Model

SheetXL introduces the **Range**, a unified data model that combines the power of **interactive spreadsheets**
and **data science computation**, enabling you to easily build high-performance, user-driven data applications.

The **Range** concept comes in two "flavors".

| Flavor | Inspired By | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`IRange`** | Data Science Libraries (NumPy, pandas) | High-speed, in-memory computation. |
| **`ICellRange`**| Traditional Spreadsheets (Excel, Sheets) | Live interaction with worksheet cells. |

Both flavors share the same set of design principles with aligned APIS that operate using **vectorized operations**
to ensure speed and data integrity while also providing methods to **access individual scalar values** when
a finer level of control is needed.

### **IRange**: The Data API

For pure computation and data manipulation, use the **`IRange`**.

An `IRange` is a lightweight, **immutable** snapshot of data that lives entirely in memory. Because it's disconnected from the live sheet, its operations are extremely fast and guaranteed to be safeâ€”you never have to worry about a formula accidentally changing your source data.

### **ICellRange**: The Interactive API

To interact with the spreadsheet itself, use the **`ICellRange`**.

An `ICellRange` is a **live connection** to your worksheet. It gives you direct, "remote control" access to the cells, allowing you to **mutate** the sheet. Its methods allow you to change **formulas**, **formatting**, and **layouts** through safe,
transactional mutations, which are automatic or controlled explicitly with `doBatch()`.

### Switching between the two

The real power of this model comes from how the two flavors work together. The typical workflow is a clear, three-step process: **read, compute, and write**.

1. **Read from the sheet:** Start with an `ICellRange` to select a live range of cells.
2. **Compute in memory:** Call `.toIRange()` on the `ICellRange` to create a safe, high-performance `IRange` snapshot for calculations.
3. **Write back to the sheet:** Use a destination `ICellRange` with a method like `.setValues()` to write your results back into the workbook.

`IRange` is the API used when creating **formula functions** and `ICellRange` is typically used for **macros**.

## Core Concepts & Features

Here's a deeper look at the design principles that make the **Range** model so powerful.

### **IRange** Features

`IRange` is built for performance and safety, borrowing proven concepts from modern data science tools.

* **Vectorized & Columnar:** An `IRange` stores data in columns, similar to **Apache Arrow** and **pandas**. This columnar layout optimizes memory access, allowing for highly efficient **vectorized computations** that operate on entire datasets at once, rather than looping through individual cells.

* **Immutable & Functional:** `IRange` is immutable by design. Every transformation (e.g., `resize()`, `filter()`) returns a **new `IRange` instance** instead of changing the original. This functional approach eliminates side effects, making your code safer and more predictable. It also enables expressive workflows through **method chaining**.

* **Zero-Copy Architecture:** Most transformations are "zero-copy," meaning they don't duplicate data in memory. This makes operations like `broadcast()` and `map()` incredibly fast and memory-efficient.

### **ICellRange** Features

`ICellRange` extends the power of the vector engine with the interactive features needed for a rich spreadsheet experience.

* **UI-Aware Functionality:** It provides the complete API for visual and interactive operations. This includes managing cell **styles**, values, formulas, and worksheet layout with methods like `getStyle()` or `autoFit()`.

* **Transactional Mutations:** While `IRange` is immutable, `ICellRange` is designed to perform **safe mutations**.
Its methods provide an interface for changing the underlying data with automatic transactions or within
`doBatch()` operations.

### The Best of Both Worlds

The Unified Range Model gives you the best of two worlds, without compromise:

* The Data Science World: You get the raw computational power, speed, and safety of modern data analysis libraries
through the `IRange` API.
* The Spreadsheet World: You get the familiar, interactive, and visually rich experience of a traditional spreadsheet,
powered by `ICellRange`.
