# SheetXL Performance Benchmarks

**Last Updated:** August 4, 2025

## Performance Matters

<div style={{ float: 'right', margin: '10px 0 20px 20px', maxWidth: 160 }}>
  <SvgPerformance
    alt="Performance illustration"
    style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: 'auto',
      borderRadius: 12,
      padding: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
    }}
  />
</div>

Performance is critical when working with large datasets or interactive spreadsheets.

SheetXL is optimized for performance across devices, letting you deliver fast, responsive experiences on any hardware.

<div style={{ clear: 'both' }}></div>

This page provides transparent, reproducible benchmarks for common spreadsheet
operations across a variety of hardware profiles and environments.

## Our Testing Methodology

To ensure fairness and clarity, all tests were conducted using the following scenarios and environments.

### Test Scenarios

All tests were performed on a workbook containing **1,048,576 rows (2²⁰) and 5 columns (A-E)** of pseudo-random numerical data.

* **Initial Load:** Time from component mount to the grid being rendered and interactive.
* **Large Data Scroll:** Measures UI smoothness (frame rate) while scrolling through the entire dataset. Reported as average Frames Per Second (FPS).
* **Formula Autofill:** Time to fill a new column (F) with a formula (`=SUM(A1:E1)`) and autofill it down all 1,048,576 rows. **This is our primary performance metric.**
* **Complex Calculation:** Time to recalculate the entire sheet after changing a single value in a precedent cell that affects thousands of dependent formulas.
* **Data Sort:** Time to sort the entire 1M+ row dataset by a single column.
* **File Serialization (Node.js):** Time to load a 50MB `.xlsx` file into a SheetXL instance in memory, and then save it back to a file.

### Hardware Profiles

1.  **High-End Desktop (M-Series):** Apple Mac Studio (M2 Max, 32GB RAM)
2.  **Mid-Range Laptop (Intel):** Dell XPS 15 (Intel Core i7-11800H, 16GB RAM)
3.  **Mobile Device (ARM):** Samsung Galaxy S21 (Snapdragon 888, 8GB RAM) - _from 2021_
4.  **Server Environment (Node.js):** Standard AWS EC2 `t3.large` Instance (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)

## Philosophy

SheetXL's performance is the result of a purpose-built, vectorized calculation engine. Unlike traditional data grids
that struggle with complex calculations, or spreadsheet components that rely on inefficient cell-by-cell processing,
our range-based API is designed for bulk operations.

This architecture allows SheetXL to deliver a fluid user experience even with massive datasets, all while running
entirely client-side, reducing server costs and simplifying your infrastructure.

We are confident that these numbers represent a new standard for performance in web-based spreadsheets.
