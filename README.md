built to power everything from lightweight grid widgets to massive enterprise-scale calculation engines

Key features:

* **Blazing Speed:** Executes 10M+ operations per second and handles spreadsheets with 17B+ cells.
* **Powerful API:** A modern, vectorized, range-based API for precise, scriptable control over data ‚Äî independent of any UI.

### Applications and UI Toolkits

Build UIs your way ‚Äî from plug-and-play dashboards to fully custom design systems.

## ü§î Why SheetXL?

We believe developers have been forced to compromise between powerful but closed spreadsheet apps and flexible but limited data grids for too long. SheetXL was built to end that compromise.

### Why not just a spreadsheet app?

Importing and Exporting data from a spreadsheet is a broken part of nearly every business workflow. Instead of
importing/exporting data, just import the spreadsheet.

* Reduce errors on data due to import/export copying of data.
* Real time integration/validation of your data.
* Complete control of data as your data never leaves your systems.
* Improved user productivity.
* Combine custom user enhancements with flexible data manipulation.

### Why not just a spreadsheet component?

As a Microsoft Excel user and a React developer I have always wanted a solution that combines the flexibility and ease of use of Excel with the control and specific capabilities of my custom application.

I wanted my custom applications to have spreadsheet features!

Several great spreadsheet components exists but none of them have:

* Excel compatibility and features.
* Simple integration.
* Billions of cells.
* Comprehensive support for keyboard shortcuts (e.g. tabbing within multi-selected ranges, arrow-keys within cells).
* Enable advanced copy / paste between Excel/Excel Online/Google Sheets.
* Easily extendable libraries that use open-source and modern design patterns.
* Real-time integration to data providing a single source of truth; no copying data between systems using complex APIs.

## The Competitive Landscape

We encourage you to explore the landscape. We're confident you'll see why we built SheetXL.

A data-grid is a sub-component within a spreadsheet that provides base grid-level rendering but without many of the
spreadsheet features (user styling, formulas, Excel compatibility, etc). Features vary by product but generally
include sorting, filtering, grouping, and basic cell editing.
